I've prepared two problems for you.

The first one relates to making a multiplication table. Open it by clicking [Multiplication Table Homework](./multiplication-table.md).

After you're done with that one, go on to the next one by clicking [Age Chart Homework](./age-chart.md)

Once all homework is done, you can see the cheatsheet containing concepts from the activities you've just done.

Good luck!
