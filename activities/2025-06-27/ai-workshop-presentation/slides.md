# Intro & Icebreaker

You've likely heard of the **Generative AI** boom, starting with ChatGPT in 2022.

But AI has been with us for over a decade!

-   📱 **Smartphone Cameras**: Use Computer Vision to detect faces, adjust lighting, and blur backgrounds.
-   📺 **YouTube Feed**: A recommendation system uses AI to curate videos you're most likely to watch.
-   ✈️ **Dynamic Pricing**: Airline ticket prices are set automatically based on demand, destination, and historical data.

# Demystifying AI: Core Concepts

### 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)

The broad field of computer science that enables computers to mimic human intelligence and problem-solving. It's a big umbrella!

### 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)

A type of AI that allows computers to **learn from data** without being explicitly programmed.

-   **Example**: To teach a computer to recognize cats 😺, you don't write rules like "cats have whiskers." You show it thousands of cat photos, and it learns the patterns on its own.

# Not all AI is Machine Learning

### Rule-Based AI

Some AI systems are manually programmed with complex rules and logic by humans.

-   **Example: Stockfish Chess Engine** ♟️
    -   For a long time, Stockfish was coded with a massive set of chess rules and strategies.
    -   It leverages the computer's speed and memory to calculate millions of moves, beating even the best human players.
    -   (Note: Newer versions now incorporate machine learning too!)

<br>
**Today's workshop will focus on AI that uses the Machine Learning approach.**

# Generative AI & LLMs

### Generative AI

A subset of Machine Learning that can **create new content**—text, images, audio, video, and more—by learning from vast amounts of data.

### Large Language Models (LLMs)

The technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT. They work by predicting the next most likely word in a sequence.

# The AI Toolbox: Visualize & Speak

::left::

### 🎨 To Visualize
- **Convert text into images**: Describe a scene, and the AI will generate it.
- **Edit images**: Use simple commands to add, remove, or change parts of a picture.

::right::

### 🗣️ To Speak
- **Clone your own voice**: Create a digital version of your voice that can say anything.
- **Convert text into voice**: Turn written text into natural-sounding audio.

# AI in Action: For Students

### 📚 Research & Study Assistant
- Use **NotebookLM** to upload all your research materials (PDFs, articles, YouTube links) on a topic like "Indonesian culture."
- You can then "chat" with your sources: ask questions, get summaries, and even generate flashcards and quizzes.

### 📈 Data Analyst
- Use tools like **Gemini Advanced** to analyze datasets.
- Upload an IMDb movie dataset and ask:
    - "What interesting questions can I ask about this dataset?"
    - "Generate an interactive chart showing the distribution of movie genres."
    - "Create a correlation matrix for box office revenue and ratings."

# Practical Tips & Tricks

-   🛠️ **Use specialized tools**: For organizing information from documents, **NotebookLM** is excellent. Keep each notebook focused on a specific topic.
-   💡 **Good Prompting**: Give the AI a role. For example: *"You are an experienced writing professor. Please critique this essay..."*
-   🎯 **Keep it Focused**: Don't let conversations go on for too long. LLMs have limited "memory" (context windows). Start a new chat for a new topic.
-   ✅ **Plan, Revise, Execute**: For complex tasks, ask the AI to create a plan first. You review and revise the plan. Then, tell the AI to execute your revised plan.

# The Human Element

<div class="grid grid-cols-3 gap-4 text-left">

<div>
### 🔒 Data Privacy
Be mindful of what you upload. Data is processed on company servers. While the risk of a breach is small, it's not zero. Check the terms of use.
</div>

<div>
### 👻 Hallucinations
AI models can make things up. **Always** double-check important information, especially facts and figures.
</div>

<div>
### ©️ Ownership
Be careful when using AI-generated content of famous people or brands. The legal landscape around copyright is still evolving.
</div>

</div>

### Key Risks to Understand
-   **Cognitive Offloading 📉🧠**: Don't let AI weaken your own skills. Use it as a tool, not a crutch.
-   **Agreeableness 🤗**: Some models won't correct you if you're wrong. How you ask matters.

# Looking Ahead: Career Navigation

## Augmentation, Not Replacement

The fear is that AI will take jobs. The reality is more nuanced:

> "People who use AI will replace people who don't."

<br>

-   🧭 **The Compass**: Your domain expertise (medicine, film, finance).
-   🚀 **The Engine**: The AI tools that accelerate your work.
-   🧑‍✈️ **The Driver**: **You**. Your creativity, critical thinking, and ethical judgment are irreplaceable.

<br>

Focus on developing **human-centric skills**: complex problem-solving, collaboration, emotional intelligence, and adaptability.
