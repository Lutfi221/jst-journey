I've prepared three problems for you. Do them in the following order:

1. [Spiraling Octagon](./spiraing-octagon.md)
2. [Stars in the Sky](./stars-in-the-sky.md)
3. [Chessboard](./chessboard.md)

Once all homework is done, you can see the cheatsheet containing concepts from the activities you've just done.

Good luck!
