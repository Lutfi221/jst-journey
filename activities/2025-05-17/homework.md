I've prepared three problems for you.

Before doing the problems, open the [Expected Turtle Art Results](./expected-results.md) document first. So you know what to make for each of the problem steps.

Do the problems in the following order:

1. [Spiraling Octagon](./spiraling-octagon.md)
2. [Stars in the Sky](./stars-in-the-sky.md)
3. [Chessboard](./chessboard.md)

Good luck!
